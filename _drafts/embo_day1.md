Today was the first day of a two week course on
[multi-level modelling in morphogenesis](https://www.jic.ac.uk/whats-on/events/2015/07/embo-practical-course-2015/).

During the introductory lecture, given by 
[Dr Veronica Grieneisen](https://www.jic.ac.uk/directory/veronica-grieneisen/),
the goals of the course were outlined.

A goal of the course is to spread a broader understanding of
developmental biology and biological modelling. More specifically to:

- Define and understand generic principles guiding developmental biology
- Learn how to identify and unravel processes
- Understand and discuss at what level one should "model" a phenomena
- Get exposed to different biological paradigm systems, as well as modelling formalisms
- How to obtain models **with predictive value** and **explanatory power** that **create isomorphisms**

In this context isomorphisms are corresponding abstractions and conceptual
models that can be applied to different phenomena.

At another level a goal of the course is to discuss practical aspects of
modelling. As scientists we need techniques to be able to express ourselves. As
such the course aims to open the black boxes that biologists often make use of.

At yet another level the course is about communication. In particular enabling
communication with a common language. The participants of the course are
intentionally a mix of experimental and computational biologists from many
different fields of biology. Bridging the gap between experimental and
computational biologists is a central theme of the course. As is learning how
to express oneself to people from a different fields. 

The description of the goals of the course was followed by a brief introduction
to partial differential equations starting from the conservation equation (the
differentiation form of the
[continuity equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuity_equation)),
leading into a discussion about
[flux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flux), Fick's first law and
[it's relation to diffiusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fick%27s_laws_of_diffusion).

The overview of partial differential equations was followed by a discussion on
[cellular automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton),
"to have an object or not to have an object". Three examples were described:

1. [Majority voting rule](http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/CellularAutomataWithMajorityRule/)
2. [Conway's game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
3. [Margolous diffusion/alternation](http://cell-auto.com/neighbourhood/margolus/)

The participants were then immersed in a hands on workshop exploring majority
voting and Conway's game of life. Followed by an exploration of diffusion simulated by
partial differential equations and Margolous alternation. The latter was finished off
by an exercise exploring
[diffusion-limited aggragation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion-limited_aggregation).
The pupropse of these exercies was to make biologist more familar with thinking algorithmically
and for everyone to think critically about the impact of the choice of modelling technique.
What can be seen as a feature in one instance can be an artifact in another. It all depends
on the phenomena that one is trying to model.
