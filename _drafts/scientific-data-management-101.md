## Introduction

Data management is a great challenge in the biological sciences and discussing
it is often difficult because it is a multi-faceted problem and the term "data
management" often means different things to different people.

Over the past couple of years I have become more and more involved in helping
biological research groups manage their data. The first step in this process is
typically a meeting that gathers all the members of the research group or project
with the aim of getting people onto the same page.

During these sessions the participants are often surprised to find out how
different their point of view are to other people in the group. There is
typically a split across two axis. One axis being project leaders vs post-docs
and PhD students. The former being more concerned with the long term safety and
viability of the data produced by the group and the latter being more concerned
with the limitations of the tools available for them to do their day to day
work. The other axis across which people have different points of view is that
between experimental biologists vs bioinformaticians.  The former having pain
points around managing distributed versions of Word and Excel files and the
latter struggling with having enough storage quota on the high-performance
cluster to analyse the high-throughput sequencing data produced by the group.

Having mediated many such meeting it has become clear that there is not a one
solution that fits all. Each research group and project has its own quirks and
the members need to find a solution that works for them. However, we have also
discovered that there are some general principles that can help guide a group
towards a more consistent and coherent way of managing their data.

In this post I'd like to share these guiding principles that I use to mediate
these types of group data management sessions.

## Principle 1: Make it clear who is responsible for what

## Principle 2: Keep raw data separate, safe and findable 

## Principle 3: Standardise the location and structure of data

## Principle 4: Provide metadata

## Discussion

The first two of these principles can be implemented relatively
easily.
