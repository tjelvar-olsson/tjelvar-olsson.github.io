The twelth day of the
[multi-level modelling in morphogenesis](https://www.jic.ac.uk/whats-on/events/2015/07/embo-practical-course-2015/)
course was started by
[Dr Christen Mirth](http://pages.igc.gulbenkian.pt/SCF/christen/Eco-Evo-Devo.html)
outlining the methods and theory of
[evolutionary-developmental biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_developmental_biology)
(eco-devo).

In nature (and the lab) one can observe
[polymorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)). Sources
of these polymorphic variations include both genetic and environmental factors.
Meaning that the phenotype is composed of interactions between the
genotype and the environment. This results in
[phenotypic plasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypic_plasticity),
the ability of an organism to react to an environmental input with a change
in form, state, or behaviour.

Many different organisms show striking examples of phenotypic plasticity.
Famous examples include:

- *Daphnia cuclatta*
- *Nemorai arizonaria*
- *Priceis coenia*

Furthermore there are many different inducers of phenotypic plasticity:
predators, food, temparture and day length respectively for the examples
listed above.

Looking at different phenotypes one can observe that they can have differing
degrees of plasticity.

In order  to go from an environmental queue to a difference in phenotype
several mechanistic steps are required. The queue must be sensed by the
organism. Some sort of signal must then be sent to the relevant tissue.
The tissue must then interpret the signal and respond accordingly.

Dr Mirth then used the example of horn development in male dung beetles
as a case study to illustrate how these processes may occur. Male
dung beetles can either develop horns or become hornless. This
dimorphism depends on larval nutrition provided by the mother.

One of the central problems for this particular example is that the
horned and hornless dung beetles grow to the same size given the same
amount of nutrition. So how does it regulate the size of the horn independently
of the body size?

This is where the degrees of plasticity come into play. Where the
initial levels of nutrients during development affect the plasticity
of the horn growth relative growth.

In the last section of her talk Dr Mirth discussed the patterning
of Drosophila wings, focussing in particular on the question of
pattern coordination. From an impressive set of experiments looking
at the expression levels of different hormones during development
Dr Mirth managed to show, by perturbing the system, that the organ
patterning is coordinated by a set of specific milestones.
