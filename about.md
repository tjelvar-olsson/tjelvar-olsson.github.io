My name is Tjelvar and I am a Swede enjoying life in Norwich. I help people
use computers to do better science.

I work as a scientific computing lab manager at the John Innes Centre. It's a
great place to work as I get to participate in cutting edge science and play
with the latest technology. My role involves providing services and training in
areas such as image analysis, bioinformatics and programming.

I did my undergraduate and PhD in biochemistry at University College London,
where I spent most of my spare time practising Shorinji Kempo (a Japanese
martial art).

After finishing my PhD I got a job as an applications scientist at the
Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre where I learnt lots about molecular
modelling and software development. However, after six years Cambridge was no
longer the city for me so I moved on to Norwich.

I am interested in how science and technology impact individuals and society at
large. In particular how we can use computers and software to do better
research and make life easier for ourselves.

I hope you find this blog useful.
