I'm Tjelvar, a Swede enjoying life in Norwich. I help people use computers to do better science.

With a background in life sciences and over 20 years of experience at the intersection of science and computing, I specialize in leveraging technology to unlock scientific potential, increase automation, and improve decision-making.

After earning a PhD in Biochemistry, I developed software and databases for drug design at the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre. I then spent seven years at the John Innes Centre, supporting plant researchers—first with image analysis, then with data management, high-performance computing, and infrastructure. Most recently, I spent four years at Exscientia, a Fortune 50 pharmatech AI company, where I built high-performing teams and led projects to create scalable platforms for scientific computing in the cloud.

## Coaching  

In addition to my technical work, I'm a certified coach with a Level 5 Certificate and Diploma in Effective Coaching and Mentoring from the Institute of Leadership and Management. I help scientists and engineers navigate non-technical challenges with confidence.
