My name is Tjelvar and I am a Swede enjoying life in Norwich. I help people
use computers to do better science.

I'm a Senior Scientific Data and Infrastructure Manager at the John Innes
Centre. It's a great place to work as I get to participate in cutting edge
science and play with the latest technology. My role involves providing
services and training in areas such as data management, bioinformatics and
programming.

It is a job that requires excessive use of Post-it notes to keep track of projects.

And some infrastructure for compute and storage.

I did my undergraduate and PhD in biochemistry at University College London,
where I spent most of my spare time practising Shorinji Kempo (a Japanese
martial art).

After finishing my PhD I got a job as an applications scientist at the
Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre where I learnt lots about molecular
modelling and software development. However, after six years Cambridge was no
longer the city for me so I moved on to Norwich.

I am interested in how science and technology impact individuals and society at
large. In particular how we can use computers and software to do better
research and make life easier for ourselves.

I hope you find this blog useful. If you need in-depth help with scientific
data management I'm available for consultancy.
