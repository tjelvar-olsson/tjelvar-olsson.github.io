This summer I went to a Research Data Alliance meeting in London. The meeting
was about persistent identifiers, and my goal was to meet like-minded people
that care about data. During the meeting I got talking to Sarah Callaghan.
Sarah described *Patterns*; the new data science journal she was setting up.
After the meeting our discussion continued via email and Skype and Sarah asked
me to become a member of the academic advisory board.

Data science is an emerging discipline that is gaining more and more attention
both in academia and industry. It is a multi-disciplinary field and it is not
limited to data analysis. It also includes topics such as data cleaning,
computational infrastructure, as well as legal and policy aspects of data. This
can present problems for academic researchers. How do you publish, and get
credit for, work that you have done on developing data science infrastructure
or policy?

In this interview Sarah describes how Cell Press are creating a new journal,
called *Patterns*, to try to help alleviate this and other problems with
knowledge sharing in data science. Sarah has a 20-year career in creating,
managing, and analysing scientific data and she is *Patterns’* Editor-in-Chief.

**Tjelvar Olsson:** What prompted the creation of *Patterns*?

**Sarah Callaghan:** Data are everywhere, and we’re producing more and more of it
as time goes by. A lot of the time that data creation is intentional, like when
a researcher designs and runs an experiment and collects the data. Sometimes
that data creation is unintentional, like when a supermarket customer buys one
brand instead of another. But regardless of how the data was created, there are
uses for it, whether that’s in developing new science, or in figuring out how
to market a new type of toothpaste.

One common trend across all the domains that create and manage data is this:
everyone has common problems in dealing with data. Everyone, whether they’re an
astronomer or a zoologist, has problems with data collection, cleaning, sharing
with other researchers, understanding the legal and policy aspects of data,
analysing it, and publishing it. And researchers in different domains have come
up with solutions to those problems that work in their particular domain, but
could also be usefully shared across domains.

That cross-disciplinary knowledge sharing is growing, but it’s not quite there
yet. *Patterns* is all about providing a forum for researchers to share their
data-related solutions, tools, methods and analyses across multiple domains.
There is a lot of really exciting and innovative work out there that has not
gotten out to the wider world – *Patterns* is here to help change that!

**TO:** That sounds fantastic. I certainly know the feeling of struggling to find
out how others have tackled problems that I’m facing working with scientific
infrastructure and data management. It would be great to be able to read about
solutions and lessons learnt by others.

I’ve never met anyone who has set up a new journal before. What are the
challenges involved in this?

**SC:** Lots! First and foremost, the main challenge is getting the word out.
People can’t submit their articles to a journal that they don’t know exists. So
(at the risk of going all marketing-speak) building a journal brand is
important. That includes setting a scope and aims that will suit the journal
audience, and recruiting an advisory board who will promote the journal in
their own networks.

Getting people enthused and interested in the journal is also vital, especially
in the case of *Patterns*, where we’re bringing together different communities
into a new, more-inclusive group. Data are fundamental to research, regardless
of what your domain is, so *Patterns* is bringing together computer scientists,
data stewards and engineers, and researchers in data-intensive domains in order
to share solutions and knowledge.

Commissioning papers for a new journal is also a challenge. Because *Patterns* is
new, there can be a bit of convincing required to get authors to submit their
articles to my journal, rather than a more established one. This is where
*Patterns* cross-disciplinary focus and open access nature have added value –
it allows researchers to reach readers outside their usual domains.

From a personal point of view, setting up a new journal means a lot of
travelling to conferences and meetings, and even more talking to people about
their research in order to commission papers (which to be fair, I do enjoy).
And email. Lots of email!

**TO:** It sounds like you get to talk to lots of people about data science. I
think this means that you have your finger on the pulse in this field. How do
you think data science and management will develop over the next ten years?

**SC:** I think there’ll be a lot more of it, and there will be different
variations in the roles and job titles associated with data. At the moment, a
“data scientist” role can cover a wide range of skills and talents, and as a
title, it means different things to different people.

I also think that we’re on the cusp of a change in the way that data is
produced and dealt with. The closest analogy I can think of is the industrial
revolution, where goods moved from being produced as piecework, done by
individuals, to being produced in factories. Historically, with data, datasets
have been hand created in their own formats by individuals or small groups. The
landscape has moved to large scale data creation, and to deal with the issues
that come out of that, you need things like infrastructure and standards to
drive tools and services. 

Academics aren’t the only ones doing research into data science – there is a
lot of very interesting and exciting work being done in the business domain. I
expect, in the next decade or so, that we will see more of the innovations
developed by business to work with data rolled out more widely across research.
This is already happening with advances in computer vision for example. And
it’s only a little stretch to see how the same artificial intelligence network
that can count people in a crowd could be repurposed to count antelope in a
herd.

**TO:**  What types of manuscripts should people be submitting to *Patterns*?

**SC:** I am always looking out for exciting, innovative original research
where a data science solution has been applied to a problem in a research
domain, and that solution has the potential to be applied to different domains
too. The solution doesn’t have to be complete, in fact *Patterns* has developed
a Data Science Maturity Level scale in order to help readers understand what
stage the research is at. 

*Patterns* also publishes descriptor articles – which are papers that describe a
data science resource, whether that’s a dataset, piece of software,
infrastructure, workflow, algorithm, even a piece of hardware. As long as the
resource can be uniquely and unambiguously identified and is useful to the
wider community, then an article about it is in scope. This allows the
researchers who spend their time building, for example, infrastructures, to
gain academic credit for their work.

I am also interested in opinion pieces and reviews on topics of interest to the
community. Reviews can be on the literature around a certain topic in data
science (e.g. GANs, blockchain, knowledge graphs, etc.) or can be on types of
software and tools, highlighting their strengths, weaknesses and uses for the
community.

Fundamentally, I want to publish interesting, exciting and innovative work that
people from a wide range of domains want to read!

**TO:** Where can people find out more about *Patterns* and how to submit
manuscripts to it?

**SC:**  We have a very pretty and informative website at
[http://www.cell/com/patterns](http://www.cell/com/patterns) where you can find
all the information needed by authors to write and submit their article. This
includes details of the article types, and the aims and the scope of
*Patterns*.  There’s also the link on that page to the system where you can
submit your manuscript, and also another link so that you can get the journal
e-table of contents delivered free to your inbox when each issue is released. 

We’re on Twitter too ([@Patterns_CP](https://twitter.com/Patterns_CP)) where we’ll be promoting our content and
also sharing cool and interesting data science things (and pretty pictures of
interesting patterns I come across when out and about). 

And of course, if the readers of this interview have any other questions, or
want to discuss whether or not their research is suitable for *Patterns*, then
I’d be very glad to hear from you! My email is s.callaghan@cell.com

I’d just like to finish up by saying that the future for data science is bright
– let’s make it together!
