Covid-19 is causing world wide chaos and it is terrible. However that is not
what this post is about. This post is about staying positive and finding
opportunities.  Why?  Amidst this chaos it is important to stay sane. You are
no good to anyone if you become a nervous wreck. You need to stay strong to be
able to help your family and friends. 

My work is basically centered around helping people get more scientific value
out of the computational resources we have available to us. Some of it is
technical; working with computers. And some of it is softer; working with
people.  Just over a week ago I started working from home.  The technical
aspects of my work have been relatively easy to transition.  The softer parts
of my work still have some way to go. I'm learning more and more about
different types of video conferencing software. To me this presents an
opportunity because I have wanted to do more home working for a while. The
current situation has accelerated that process and I'm keen to make sure I
learn to work from home more efficiently.

Clearly it is easier to work from home if your research is mainly
computational.  However, if you are a bench scientist perhaps this presents new
opportunities for you as well. Perhaps this presents an opportunity to learn more
about computational approaches? Perhaps this is the time to learn R? If you
are looking for something like this I have written a book to help you:
[The Biologist's Guide to Computing](http://biologistsguide2computing.com/)
(it is free).

Or perhaps this presents an opportunity to go over all your old data?  (Or,
heaven forbid, an opportunity to do some data management? I have also written
software to make this easier: [dtool](https://peerj.com/articles/6562/). It is
also free.) Going over old data with fresh eyes can sometimes lead to new
insights and generate ideas for new manuscripts. Speaking of manuscripts
perhaps this period of working at home presents an opportunity for you to
finish up and submit those manuscripts that have been weighing on your mind for
the past couple of years.

On a different note, schools closed in the UK on Monday and it is likely to
remain that way for the next four months or so. I'll therefore be one of the
many parents juggling home schooling and working at the same time.

What opportunities present themselves here?

I'll be spending much more time with my son. That means that I'll have an
opportunity to teach him about things where I have specialist knowledge.
In particular I am hoping to teach him Python programming.
There are lots of great books out there for teaching kids how to program.
I've invested in a copy of *Computer Coding Python Games for Kids*, because I
had a good experience with a similar book called *Coding Games in Scratch* from
the same series.

I do not have the skill to do anything to help stop the spread of Covid-19.
However, I do have the skills to help you develop your computational and
data management expertise. Please get in touch if this is something that you
would be interested in. Stay safe, stay sane and stay positive!
