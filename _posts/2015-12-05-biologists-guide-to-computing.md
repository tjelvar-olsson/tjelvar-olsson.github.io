The reason there has been a bit of a radio silence on this blog for the past
couple of months is that I have been spending most of my spare time working on
a booklet about computing.

The booklet is intended for biologists that want to learn more about data
analysis. It will provide an introduction to some fundamental aspects of
computing required for learning scripting and programming. Furthermore, as well
as outlining basic principles of programming it will introduce some best
practices for keeping track of work and collaborating on projects.

These days many parts of the biological sciences are become more and more data
driven. Technological advancements have led to a huge increase in the
generation of biological data. Data analysis is required to extract biological
insights from this data. To a large extent the rate limiting factor in
generating biological insight is the lack of appropriate data analysis tools.

In these instances computers can be powerful allies. They are ideal for
automating repetitive tasks. Furthermore, they can perform calculations and
analysis that would be infeasible for the human brain alone.

The purpose of this booklet is not to provide a bundle of useful scripts and
regular expressions. Its purpose, is rather, to outline a more productive way
of working that will make you a better scientist.
