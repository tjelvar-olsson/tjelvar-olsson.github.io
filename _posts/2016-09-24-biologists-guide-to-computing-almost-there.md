Last week I announced the launch of the
[Biologist's Guide to Computing](http://biologistsguide2computing.com/)
website and the response was tremendous.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;ve created a website for the book that I am working on: The biologist&#39;s guide to computing.

Thank you all!

I thought I'd take the opportunity to provide a status update.

The first draft of the book is finished. Yay! In its current form
it has 47,000 words, spread over 195 pages, split into 14 chapters.

Although, I call it the first draft each chapter has undergone several
revisions as I have received feedback from many of my colleague, to whom I am
very grateful. Thanks to Nadia Radzman, Sam Mugford and Anna Stavrinides for
providing feedback on early versions of the initial chapters. Many thanks to
Tyler McCleary for continued in depth feedback and suggestions for
improvements.  Thanks also to Nick Pullen for feedback and discussions on the
data visualisation chapter. Finally, many thanks to Matthew Hartley for
all the discussions and encouragement.

*So what happens now?*

I will go over the draft with a red pen and I'm sure that I will find plenty of
things that needs fixing.

Then I will make the book available more broadly under creative commons
licence to get more feedback.

I'm currently debating if I should try to get a publisher or if I should
self publish. Does anyone have any thoughts or recommendations with regards
to this?

If I go down the self publishing route I'd like to find a copy editor
that has some grasp of both coding and biology. Does anyone know of such
a person?

Finally, I am pondering how I can publicise the book. Please do help me spread
the word by pointing people at the [Biologist's Guide to
Computing](http://biologistsguide2computing.com/) website. The website has
a newsletter sign up form, please do sign up to it.
By signing up you encourage me to finish the project! Also, if you
are a blogger and would consider writing a review of the book I will give you
early access to it. Please do get in touch if you would be interested in this.
